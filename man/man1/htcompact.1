.Nm
script takes files and directories as input with given flags and
prints out a readable result of found HTCondor log files
.Pp
Its arguments are as follows:

An other usage is related to the --filter option,
see the --filter section below.
.
.It Fl s | Fl Fl summarize
summarizes all given HTCondor log files and return a result regarding the averange usages and runtimes,
this only makes sense, if multiple log files are given
.

execution status, runtime and much more

.Sh CONFIG
.Bd -literal -compact
furthermore all these variables|settings can be set inside a config file.
See the Config specification:
.Lk https://github.com/psyinfra/htcompact/blob/master/CONFIG.md
.
The script is also checking for other config files in other places:
.
"project_directory/config", "/etc" and "~/.config/htcompact/"
.Ed
.Bd -literal
with different priorities from 1 (high) to 5 (low):
Priority[1] find config_file directly
Priority[2] search for config_file in project_directory/config
Priority[3] search for config_file in /etc
Priority[4] search for config_file in ~/.config/htcompact
Priority[5] run with default settings

.Sh FEATURES
.Bd -literal -compact
- Always try to generate output, if possible
- Listening to stdin to make the use of tools like grep possible
-> --filter is a more naive alternative to grep
