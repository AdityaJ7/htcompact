#
# This config file will take all the variables that are set as default,
# the script is also checking for other config files in other places "/etc" and "~/.config/HTCompact/"
# with different priorities from 1 (high) to 4 (low):
# Priority[1] find config_file directly
# Priority[2] search for config_file in /etc
# Priority[3] search for config_file in ~/.config/HTCompact
# Priority[4] take the "setup.conf" from the Project (this file)
# The idea is, that with this file it's easy to just run the script via
# python3 HTCompact.py
# with no need of arguments
#
# Values will be accepted as True for : ["true", "yes", "y", "ja", "j", "enable", "enabled", "wahr", "0"]
